The short introduction from Emmanuel Paradis allows a quick start

   - [''R for Beginners''](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Paradis-rdebuts_en.pdf) by Emmanuel Paradis.

Longer book allow a deepening. See for example

  - [''Using R for Data Analysis and Graphics - Introduction, Examples and Commentary''](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/usingR.pdf) by John Maindonald.



### R from RStudio developers

  -  [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)   The book of Wickam about more recent R development for data science

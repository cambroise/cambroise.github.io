## About Me

I am professor of statistics at University of Evry val d’Essone. My research interests include machine learning, statistics in high-dimension and applications in medicine and genomics. I lead the [Statistic and Genome group](http://www.math-evry.cnrs.fr/sg/welcome) of the [LaMME](http://www.math-evry.cnrs.fr/doku.php) (Laboratory of Mathematic and Modeling of Evry Val d’Essone).

These results are the subject of a publication in the journal Nature Communications. For more details in french, see this article.\nProject description Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat and its development is promoted by antibiotic misuse. While disk diffusion antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST, also called antibiogram) is broadly used to test for antibiotic resistance in bacterial infections, it faces strong criticism because of inter-operator variability and the complexity of interpretative reading. Automatic reading systems address these issues, but are not always adapted or available to resource-limited settings. We present an artificial intelligence (AI)-based, offline smartphone application for antibiogram analysis. The application captures images with the phone’s camera, and the user is guided throughout the analysis on the same device by a user-friendly graphical interface. An embedded expert system validates the coherence of the antibiogram data and provides interpreted results. The fully automatic measurement procedure of our application’s reading system achieves an overall agreement of 90% on susceptibility categorization against a hospital-standard automatic system and 98% against manual measurement (gold standard), with reduced inter-operator variability. The application’s performance showed that the automatic reading of antibiotic resistance testing is entirely feasible on a smartphone. Moreover our application is suited for resource-limited settings, and therefore has the potential to significantly increase patients’ access to AST worldwide.\n","date":1614384000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614384000,"objectID":"d3ac572cc67d402ec2d02cba652bfc4d","permalink":"https://cambroise.github.io/project/antibiogo/","publishdate":"2021-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/antibiogo/","section":"project","summary":"AI-based

a seamless experience. You can focus on the content and Academic handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you\u0026rsquo;ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Academic.\nExamples Code Academic supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./line-chart.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-138679524', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math.

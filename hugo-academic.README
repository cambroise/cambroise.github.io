Hi @damonlynch, I see you are making good progress on your website 👍🏻. Let me reply in two parts:

1. Using external icon sets (e.g. Academicons)

You simply need to include the respective stylesheet; in your case, that would be

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jpswalsh/academicons@1/css/academicons.min.css">
in the <head>-tag of your site.

To achieve this, you may create a layouts/partials/custom_head.html in your site's root directory containing this line:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jpswalsh/academicons@1/css/academicons.min.css">
With the stylesheet available you can then use the icons as it is described on their website, i.e., using <i>-tags like

<i class="ai ai-google-scholar-square"></i>
in your .html-content.

If you want to use icons in .md-files, you could enable HTML-rendering via adding

[markup]
    [markup.goldmark]
        [markup.goldmark.renderer]
            unsafe = true
to your config.toml.

2. What's built-in?

You are correct, this is a little bit of a hidden feature at the moment 😸, but as you already saw, there is an icon on the header of the start page. This theme currently includes font-awesome v4.0.3 for that purpose. You can check out https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/cheatsheet/ for a list of all icons.

You can use all those icons in .html via <i>-tags <i class="fa fa-envelope"></i>. Again, if you want to use theme in .md-files, you need to enable unsafe-rendering for markdown, see above.

2.5 😅 Future Work

To make using icons in .md-files a lot nicer / user-friendly, we could introduce a shortcode. Then, you would not need to enable unsafe-rendering and could write something like

{{< i class="fa fa-envelope">}} Mail me!
in your usual .md-file.

You can add this functionality locally by creating a layouts/shortcodes/i.html-file with the following content:

{{ with .Get "class" }}<i class="{{ . }}"></i>{{ end }}
I hope that helps 😄 . Let me know if this works for you.

Kind regards,
Jan
